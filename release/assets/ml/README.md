This training dataset is derived from the original MNIST database available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

File format:

Each file has 1000 training examples. Each training example is of size 28x28 pixels. The pixels are stored as unsigned chars (1 byte) and take values from 0 to 255. The first 28x28 bytes of the file correspond to the first training example, the next 28x28 bytes correspond to the next example and so on.
